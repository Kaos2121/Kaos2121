 üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Kaos2121



- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in a wide array of topics within technology and software development. My primary focus is on **web development**, **backend systems**, and **cryptography**. I also have a deep passion for **machine learning**, **data science**, and **automation**.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently expanding my knowledge and skills in various programming languages and frameworks, including but not limited to:

  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:** For building dynamic web applications, both on the front end with frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, and on the backend with Node.js.
  
  - **Python:** For a variety of tasks including automation, data analysis with pandas, machine learning with TensorFlow, and web development with Django and Flask.
  
  - **Java:** Used primarily in enterprise-level applications, Android development, and backend services with frameworks like Spring Boot.
  
  - **C#:** Particularly for game development with Unity and building Windows applications using .NET framework.
  
  - **C++:** For system-level programming, performance-critical applications, and game development.
  
  - **Go:** For building high-performance and scalable server-side applications.
  
  - **Rust:** For safe and efficient system-level programming, particularly in performance-critical environments.
  
  - **Ruby:** For web development, particularly with the Ruby on Rails framework.
  
  - **PHP:** For server-side scripting and dynamic web page generation, particularly with CMS platforms like WordPress.
  
  - **SQL:** For database management and complex querying with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
  
  - **NoSQL:** For working with non-relational databases like MongoDB and Cassandra.
  
  - **Bash/Shell Scripting:** For automating tasks and managing Unix/Linux systems.
  
  - **HTML/CSS:** For building responsive, user-friendly web interfaces with a focus on accessibility and performance.
  
  - **Kotlin:** For modern Android application development.
  
  - **Swift:** For iOS/macOS app development.
  
  - **R:** For statistical computing and graphics, particularly in the context of data science.
  
  - **Matlab:** For numerical computing and algorithm development, particularly in engineering fields.
  
  - **Lua:** For scripting in embedded systems and game engines like Love2D and Roblox.
  
  - **Perl:** For text processing and system administration tasks.
  
  - **Assembly Language (x86, ARM):** For low-level programming and understanding computer architecture.
  
  - **Haskell:** For exploring functional programming paradigms and building reliable software with type safety.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on open-source projects, particularly those that involve **distributed systems**, **blockchain technology**, or **AI/ML frameworks**. I am also keen on contributing to projects that focus on **privacy and security**.

- üì´ How to reach me: Feel free to reach out to me via **GitHub Discussions**, **Twitter**, or through **email** at [kaos2121@example.com](mailto:kaos2121@example.com). I am open to networking, collaboration inquiries, and discussing innovative ideas.

- üòÑ Pronouns: He/Him

- ‚ö° Fun fact: I have a strong passion for learning new languages, both programming and spoken. Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring different cultures and languages, currently learning **Japanese**, **Spanish**, and **German**. I also love spending time outdoors, hiking, and playing chess.
